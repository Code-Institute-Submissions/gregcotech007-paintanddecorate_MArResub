# User Experience (UX)

## User Story


### First Time Visitors

As a First Time Visitor, I wanted to provide an easy to view website that provides information in relation to the services provided for the company, "Paint & Decorate".

As a First Time Visitor, I wanted to provide a 'Get in Touch' button that allows the user easy access to get in touch with the company. The link points to the About Page, where the user has the option to complete the form. There is a drop-down menu to choose between 'Get a Quote' or 'General Enquiry'.

As a First Time Visitor, I wanted to make the website responsive so that the user can move through the website easily, regardless if they are on mobile, tablet or desktop device.


### Realtime User Experience

The user accessed the website from their mobile Android device. The found it easy to link through the pages and the content was correctly displayed to the screen.

The user clicked on each of the links that corresponded to the hamburger menu navigation, which consisted of 4 pages: Home, About, Gallery & Services.

The user found the colour scheme used was easy on the eye and the quality of the images on the gallery were of a high quality.


### Realtime User Suggestions

There was no future feature suggestions at this time.


# Design

To better understand how the website was going to come together, it was better to compile ideas and either put them down on paper or use the digitial wireframe, or both.

Once the layouts were designed, it was easier to see how the site would be structured and how the layout would look on the different device screen sizes. Also, the content on the screen layout would also change. It is easier to visual plan the content view when you can see it laid out and therefore that saves time when the coding is ready to start.

- Wireframes: [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

    - Mobile Device Wireframes.
    - Desktop Device Wireframes.

- Colour Scheme
    - I chose to use colours #f4f4f4, #35424a, #fff, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), #e8491d, #ccc, #c8c8c8 & #3a3a3a across the website. The colours worked well together and provided a good visual experience to the user.

- Typography
    - The main font used on the website was Google Fonts: Open Sans & Poppins.

- Imagery
    - The imagery used on the website is loyalty-free.


#  Features


## Header

The header is consists of a company logo with the emphasis on the owners name as it is shown as larger and a brighter colour compared to the rest of the logo.

On the right-side of the header, there is a hamburger navigation menu which is diplayed for the mobile first view as shown in the following image:

Once the screen size is increased to 768px or higher, then the hamburger menu disappears and it displays the navigation bar menu instead. See for following image:
