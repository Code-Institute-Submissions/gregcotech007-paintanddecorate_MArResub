# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories


### First Time Visitors

- As a First Time Visitor, I wanted to provide an easy to view and navigate a website that provides information in relation to the services provided by the company, "Paint & Decorate".

- As a First Time Visitor, I wanted to provide a 'Get in Touch' button that allows the user easy access to get in touch with the company. The link points to the About Page, where the user has the option to complete the form. There is a drop-down menu to choose between 'Get a Quote' or 'General Enquiry'.

- As a First Time Visitor, I wanted to make the website responsive so that the user can move through the website easily, regardless if they are on mobile, tablet or desktop device.


### Realtime User Experience

- The user accessed the website from their mobile Android device. They found it easy to navigate through the pages and the content was correctly linked and displayed to the screen.

- The user clicked on each of the links that corresponded to the hamburger menu navigation, which consisted of 4 pages: Home, About, Gallery & Services.

- The user found the colour scheme was easy on the eye and the quality of the images on the gallery were of a high quality.


### Realtime User Suggestions

- No future feature suggestions at this time.


# Design

- The design of the website was inspired by researching other websites to find out what designs created a positive user experience.

- Consideration was also researched for how the design would be impacted by viewing the content on multiple browsers and browser types.

- Designs were created using a digital interface such as Balsamiq and that provided the design a loayout view for both mobile and tablet view as shown below.

- Wireframes: [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

    - Mobile Device Wireframe.

    - Tablet Device Wireframe.

    ![Tablet Device Wireframe](assets/images/pd-tablet-wireframe.webp)

## Bug Testing
- During the testing phase, I found that there was an issue between the view results on the Dev Tools and Google Chrome, that caused the Testimonials to move out of position and display over the Newsletter Signup. This was not the case when viewed on the Google Chrome directly. This was as a result of the testimonials width set to 30.73%.

    - Changed CSS code for testimonial width to 30%. 
    - Font-size was reduced from 2vw to 1.8vw. 
    - Testimonial span font-size was reduced from 3vw to 2.8vw.

    - Removed 2nd title, added additional line comments for explantion. 
    - Added additional line spaces for better viewing of code.

- About Us
    - Article - Removed article from the About Us page that was causing an error and replaced it with a div.

- All Pages
    - aria-placeholder - Removed aria-placeholder as it was causing an error on the form.

- Footer Section 
    - Removed div from below the class social in the footer section, that was causing an error.

- Showcase Image
    - Updated showcase image to a higher quality image due to quality issues on larger screens

Once errors had been fixed, I passed code through HTML & CSS Code Beautify and then I verified the code for each page through Nu HTML Checker and all passed with no errors or warnings.

# Conclusion

I started out on this project journey a few weeks ago, not knowing what Gitpod or GitHub was. I had heard about HTML and CSS, but was not familiar with CSS or even the words div and float, to name a few.

I enjoyed learning the Code Institute LMS and completing the challenges. The course is well-structured and getting the experience on the Coders Coffeehouse and Love Running, were great projects to get started with and exposed to.

I have had a few issues along the way with my Gitpod Workspace. As a result, I had created more than 1 workspace/repo to work with and practice on. There were global issues on a couple occasions where I could not access my workspace, as it was down.

As you will notice from my commits, I had started a new repo on another GitHub profile that I created, as I couldnt get onto my existing one. I worked tirelessly over 12 hours last night to compile a brand new workspace and repo. This has had it advantages from a learning point of view, writing and rewriting code, it was allowing me to understand it better and remove any unessessary code. Also, I have spent another long night tonight to complete it and sign it off for submission. 

https://github.com/gregcodev/p1_paintanddecorate

The link above is the link for my secondary GitHub account, which will acount for the commits on the new account. I tried to log back in this evening on the new account and it advised that I had my time was used up. Luckily I had a copy of my code and I started to import it back into my existing repo and recording new commits to replace the previous code.

Overall, I have found the modules on HTML and CSS as challenging at times, I didn't lose faith with it and I kept working on it. I understand that there are many options to simplify CSS such as Flexbox and Grid CSS, but my intention was to learn and use raw CSS for the first project at least so I would get a better insight into how it works.

I would like to thank you for opportunity in reading my project and I look forward to the next challenges ahead...
